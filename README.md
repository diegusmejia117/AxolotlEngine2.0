 About this project development:
 
 This is the first time i am working on visual studio(as compiler, worked with it in conjunction with UNITY/UNREAL) as well as using GITHUB as a repository,
 i am telling you this, random citizen, as background as why i created this repository so late in the development of this engine(worked all along locally ,i know, ain't the best thing to do).
 
 So i will try to make a little commit journal so, it is recorded how i advanced this project:
 
 On november 14 /2022 i achieved to render my triangle using the class tutorial as reference and incorpated some basic camera movement(traslation, rotation)

All that week i was working on incorporatin imui in my project, having problems with external symbol erros from the Imgui library, achieving rendering windows and menus.

and by November 28 /2022 i was stuck trying to render the baker house with texture.

By December 2 /2022, i am trying to implement mesh drop in and to fix and implement various imgui console problems as well as camera movment problems.

I will keep learning in this master(certainly i  have done more coding in 1 month than in 2 years).
